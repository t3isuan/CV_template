# CV_template
Here is an Academic CV template created by Liaoyi Xu.
# Motivation
I created this template as managing content as well as format in Microsoft - word was so hard since it had to be update very frequency and applied in multiple places. The content of most available CV templates is so crowded and too "fancy" therefore hard for other people to focus on. I personally prefer simply structure CV and easier for people find key points.
